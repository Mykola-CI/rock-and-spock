How about we go rock,
paper, scissors?

1
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.259
Ooh, I don't think so.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.369
Anecdotal evidence suggests
that in a game of rock, paper,

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.449
scissors, players familiar
with each other will tie 75 %

4
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.879
to 80 % of the time due to the
limited number of outcomes.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.999
I suggest rock, paper,
scissors, lizard, Spock.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.469
What?

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.949
It's very simple.

8
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.829
Scissors cuts paper.

9
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.989
Paper covers rock.

10
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.309
Rock crushes lizard.

11
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.709
Lizard poisons Spock.

12
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.129
Spock smashes scissors.

13
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.589
Scissors decapitates lizard.

14
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.609
Lizard eats paper.

15
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.149
Paper disproves Spock.

16
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.679
Spock vaporizes rock and as
it always has rock crushes

17
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:43.429
scissors Okay, I think
I got it rock paper

18
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.479
scissors scissors Spock
