# Rock And Spock
## Introduction
"Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" is an imaginative and humorous expansion of the classic hand game "Rock Paper Scissors," which was ingeniously invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla in 1995.

The duo sought to reduce the probability of ties that often occurred in the traditional game, especially among players who knew each other well.
By introducing two additional elements, Lizard and Spock, they created a game that was not only more complex but also injected a fresh dose of fun into the age-old pastime.

The game gained significant popularity after it was featured in the hit television series "The Big Bang Theory," particularly in the episode titled "The Lizard-Spock Expansion" which aired in 2008. The show's character Sheldon Cooper, played by Jim Parsons, famously used the game to settle disputes, explaining the quirky and expanded rules with a sense of comedic seriousness that resonated with audiences. 

This inclusion in the series catapulted "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" into the limelight, making it a cultural reference point and a beloved variant of the original game.

In this digital version of "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock," players will have the opportunity to engage in a lighthearted battle of chance against a computer opponent. The computer's hand selection is randomly generated, ensuring that each round is unpredictable and entertaining. This game is designed to be a pure game of chance, where strategy takes a backseat to the whims of fortune, providing players with a delightful and amusing diversion from the everyday.
